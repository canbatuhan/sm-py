# smpy - State Machine Framework
smpy is a framework to configure, build and run state machines with custom states and custom actions. In smpy, aim is to provide an environment, in where the programmer is able to;

- Configure a state machine easily, through configuration files such as JSON, YAML, etc.
- Build a state machine in the background, so the programmer will not be dealing with any unnecessary coding.
- Run state machine by sending events (can be custom objects, or just strings) and execute custom actions (pre-written packages, modules and functions) while running.
